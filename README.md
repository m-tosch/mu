A small, simple c++ math library

## Usage

```cpp
TODO
```

## Installation

TODO

## Documentation

The documentation can be found [TODO](https://github.com)

You can generate the documentation locally from the command line inside the `doc` folder:

```cmd
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The documentation will be generated in html form inside a  doc/html folder. View the report by opening the index.html file inside that folder in a browser.

## Tests

The unit tests are written using [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)

After successfully building the project (with cmake), you can run the unit tests locally from the command line inside the generated `build/tests` folder:

```cmd
./mu_tests
```

If you want to only print the overall test results, run the test executable like this:

```cmd
./mu_tests --gtest_brief=1
```

*note: individual test failures will still be reported if a test fails*

## Coverage

The coverage can be found [TODO](https://github.com)

The code coverage can be generated using [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) or [llvm-cov](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html). gcov uses the gcc compiler while llvm-cov uses clang. The latter was implemented to be able to inspect branch coverage through what llvm calls "region coverage".

You can generate both coverage reports locally from the command line inside the `coverage` folder:

For gcov (requires gcc)

```cmd
./coverage_gcov.sh
```

For llvm-cov (requires clang)

```cmd
./coverage_llvm.sh
```

The coverage report will be generated in html form in a `coverage/html_gcov` or a `coverage/html_llvm` folder respectively. View the report by opening the index.html file inside that folder in a browser.
