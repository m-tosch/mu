# Examples

The code snippets inside the files in this folder are referenced by the documentation.

The "examples" are implemented as code using tests (gtest), they're not just plain text or comments. This way it is verified that the snippets that are shown in the documentation can actually compile.

The tests can even be executed running the `mu_examples` executable that is written to disk when building. It can be found under `build/examples/`
